# Coffee Culture And Change

Problem: Create an interactive design of an application that we always wanted to create or an app we wanted to improve upon previously. I created Coffee Culture and Change which serve as a multifunctional application. The primary function is for a person to be able to find someone in the area and meet up for coffee to better understand their cultural background. This helps to solve the issue where people with different ideals and perceptions of life can try to understand their fellow man better.

Action: To solve this issue I created a match making application, functionally, this application works like a dating app. However, like Hinge, instead of swiping users will have a chance to like and comment on the userâ€™s profile and ask them more about an themselves. If they want to talk more about it, then the two users would meet in person. Also, users would be able to search for potential matches based on their location. So, they can look at a map and see where other users are around them. Along the way, I learned that match making heavily rely on the algorithm but they also depend on the User Experience of the application. So if I could create an application that functionally worked seamlessly users would enjoy using the application.

Results: In the end you will find an application that has all the fuctionality of a dating app but expands upon that with various features like letter drafting and finding different events in your area.

Lessons Learned: This project taught me about how to create interaction between designs. This was a fun challenge linking all the pages together and creating a functionaly prototype.
